# Virtual Showdown (User Guide)

### Requirements to Play
- Windows OS (An Intel Motherboard is **required.**).
- Bluetooth Enabled Computer (In order to connect headphones and Nintendo
Switch Joy-Con to computer.).
- Wireless Headphones or Earbuds.
- Nintendo Switch Joy-Con (To play Showdown. Not required for Showdown
Drill.).
- Kinect 2.0 with computer adapter.

### Setting Up the Kinect

1. Place the Kinect at least 3 feet off of the ground by placing it on a
table, mantel, or bookshelf. If there is no tall surface to place the
Kinect, rotate the box that packaged the Kinect sensor so it is at it\'s
tallest. Place this box on a stable surface, and place the Kinect at the
top of the box.

2. The front of the Kinect will have 3 circular indents. The Kinect should
face an open space so you have plenty of room to move safely. While we
recommend at least 6 feet of open space for your safety, the device can
be used in smaller spaces, so long as you can stand approximately 3 feet
away from the device.

3. Once the Kinect has been placed, plug the power cable for the Kinect
sensor into the wall. Depending on how your Kinect came packaged, you
may need to attach a wire from your Kinect into the power pack of this
cable to provide it power.

4. Plug the USB cable for the Kinect sensor into your computer\'s USB port.
Your computer should automatically download and install the required
files. This may take several minutes.

5. (Optional/Troubleshooting) If your drivers aren\'t downloaded
automatically (usually due to security settings), please download the
drivers and runtime dependencies
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44559).

### Pairing the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con to Your Computer

1.  Open your PC\'s settings menu (Windows Key + i)
2.  Select \"Devices\"
3.  Ensure that you are currently on the \"Bluetooth & other devices\"
    tab. You should be, as this is the default tab.
4.  If your Bluetooth toggle isn\'t on, be sure to turn it on at this
    time.
5.  On the top of the menu, select \"Add Bluetooth or other device\".
    You will want to select the \"Bluetooth\"
    option.Â ![A picture of the menu selecting Bluetooth.](https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2017/10/add-device-bluetooth.jpg?itok=BR2OeEP4)
6.  Hold down your Joy-Con\'s sync button, which is the tiny black dot
    located between the SL and SR buttons. (The SL and SR buttons are
    located on the flat side of the Joy-con when you hold it with the
    joystick facing
    you.)![A picture of the sync button, which is between the SL and SR buttons.](https://img.purch.com/fullsizerender-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9BL0IvNjkxMTM5L29yaWdpbmFsL0Z1bGxTaXplUmVuZGVyLmpwZw==)
7.  Select Joy-Con (L) or Joy-Con (R) from the menu depending on which
    controller you are using. The name will differ whether you are using
    the left or right Joy-Con. Your controller is now paired!

### Game Instructions (to Play)

Download VirtualShowdown.zip from either [GitHub](https://github.com/hekemp/virtualshowdown/releases) or [itch.io](https://hekemp.itch.io/virtual-showdown).
Click on the zip and extract all of the contents. Depending on which
unzipping software you use, you may be able to double click the zip to
unzip the contents to a new folder. Otherwise, extract all files from
the zip into one folder of your choosing using the software of your
choosing.

Click on VirtualShowdown.exe. A popup will show up asking you for new
configurations for inputs or graphics. The defaults for graphics are a
full screen game. The defaults for inputs are the arrow keys for
navigation and the enter key for confirmation. If this is okay, click on
play to load the game.

As a quick note, narrations and prompts will not be read or will be
interrupted if you make a selection or change selections using the arrow
keys or enter key while they are being spoken. Prompts will be repeated
after approximately 10 seconds if you do need a repeat.

Put your \<right/left\> hand through the wrist strap to make sure the
controller stays with you. Tighten the wrist strap. Place the controller
on your \<right/left\> hand. Hold the controller so that you are
comfortable. Make a relaxed fist around the controller. The controller
will vibrate when you leave the play area, as a hint in Showdown Drill,
as well as when you hit the ball. No controller buttons are necessary
for Showdown Drill. For Showdown, you will be asked to press any of the
controller buttons to set the ball when it is your serve. When asked
which handedness you are, please answer according to which hand you are
holding the controller in. That is, even if you are left-handed, if you
are holding the controller with your right hand, please say that you are
right-handed.

You will also wear headphones, so you can hear the ball. The headphones
will play sound based on where the ball is located. If you hear the
sound louder in your right ear, then the ball is to your right. If you
hear the ball louder in your left ear, then the ball is to your left.
Sometimes it will be in the center of the table, so you will hear the
sound equally in both ears. We suggest you move your head to locate the
ball more easily.

The sound may be different, but we designed the sound to help you find
the ball. The key is that ball gets louder as it gets closer to you.

When you leave the play area, a beeping noise will start playing. If you
hear the sound louder in your right ear, then you have moved too far to
the right. If you hear the ball louder in your left ear, then you have
moved too far to the left. If you hear it in both ears, you have either
wandered too far forward or too far back. If you have vibrations
enabled, you will feel a vibration that gets stronger the further you
are outside of the play area.

You will hear a "hitting" sound when you hit the ball, and, if you
enable vibrations, feel a vibration as well.

In Showdown Drill, you will be served a ball by a computer trainer. For
every ball, you can earn points. You earn:

- 3 points if you score a goal
- 2 points if you hit the ball past the halfway point, but do not score a
goal
- 1 point if you hit the ball but it moves slowly
- 0 points if you miss the ball

There are seven levels. You advance to the next level by hitting four
out of the past six balls. In levels 1-3, you will hear verbal hints.

First, you will hear a preview of where the ball is coming from and
where it is going. Second, as the ball is halfway across the table, you
will hear which direction you still need to move your hand if necessary.
If you have vibrations enabled, in levels 1-3 you will feel a vibration
that gets stronger as the ball moves closer towards you.

Levels four and beyond will not have hints, so the ball will move faster
as you advance.

In Showdown, you will play against a computer. Once the game has
started, the game is played to 11 points. You earn:

- 2 points for scoring a goal
- 1 point if the ball stops moving on the other side of the table

If there is a tie, you must win by 2. The play starts with a serve. When
it is your serve, place your hand where you want to start the serve
from. Then press the trigger button to set the ball down. The ball will
remain stationary on the table until you hit it.

When in the menu screens interaction with the game will be done through
the keys on the keyboard, or a mouse if you prefer. Press the up and
down arrow keys to navigate through the buttons and hit Enter when
you're ready to confirm that option. If you chose to use a mouse, simply
click on a button to confirm its option.

From the main menu, you can select one of 7 options. Choosing "Showdown"
or "Showdown Drill" will start these game modes. Choose "Update
Preferences" if you want to update your handedness or Joycon vibration
settings. To review what both game modes of "Showdown" and "Showdown
Drill" contain, select "What is Showdown" or "What is Showdown Drill"
respectively. To listen to the audio cues mentioned above (ball rolling,
ball hitting the ball, paddle hitting the ball, and the out of bounds
sound), select "Review Important Audio Sources". Make sure you listen to
them before starting the game to know what to listen for. As a note,
they will play in both ears. Finally, when you want to quit the game,
select "Quit Game".

Once body tracking has started for either Showdown Drill or Showdown,
you will then control the game modes through voice commands. You will
say "Ready" when you're ready to start the game, "Quit" to return to the
main menu, and "Restart" to restart that game mode.

### Troubleshooting \"Pairing the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con to Your Computer\":

__Question__: What should I do if my Joy-Con's syncing lights
continue to flash even after following these steps?

__Answer__: This is, unfortunately, just how the Joy-Con is
programmed to work when synced with a computer. Provided that you ran
into no errors during these steps, your device will be paired and
connected correctly, though. If the game still can't detect your
Joy-Con, go back to your Bluetooth settings (Steps 1-4 of the "Pairing
the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con to Your Computer" section) and click on the
Joy-Con under Paired Devices. You should then be able to click to forget
the Joy-Con device. Then, repeat these steps to sync the device.

__Question:__ What should I do if the device asks for a pin?

__Answer:__ Thankfully, the Switch uses the default pins for
Bluetooth devices. Try \"0000\", and if this doesn\'t work, try
\"1234\". If neither of these work, please consult your Joy-Con manual
or provider, as they may have changed the pin for the device.

# Virtual Showdown (Developer's Guide)

### Requirements:
- Windows OS (An Intel Motherboard is **required**)
- Kinect 2.0 with computer adapter 
- [Kinect 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)
- Nintendo Switch Joy-Con
- Unity
- Bluetooth Enabled Computer

### Troubleshooting:

#### Unity Services Error:

Initially, this project was created in Unity teams. Consequently, there occasionally, when first loading the project for the first time, be some errors regarding the legacy bits of configs for Unity Services. The way the team has managed to get around this is by clicking the "New Link" option to invoke a new set-up menu session and then leaving the menu. This will prevent these errors in the project, at least until a suitable solution can be achieved to remove this bug. You will receive an error similar to this when you try to export the project, but you should be able to just click to ignore it and proceed as normal.

#### DllNotFoundException: Kinect Unity Addin:

If you run into this error on the console of Unity, this means that there is something wrong with your instalation of the [Kinect 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561) or that it may be missing altogether. Be sure to go through the installation again and ensure there was no errors.
