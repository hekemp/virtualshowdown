Troubleshooting:

Unity Services Error:

Initially, this project was created in Unity teams. Consequently, there occasionally, when first loading the project for the first time, be some errors regarding the legacy bits of configs for Unity Services. The way the team has managed to get around this is by clicking the "New Link" option to invoke a new set-up menu session and then leaving the menu. This will prevent these errors in the project, at least until a suitable solution can be achieved to remove this bug.

Nintendo Switch Joycon Password Requested:
